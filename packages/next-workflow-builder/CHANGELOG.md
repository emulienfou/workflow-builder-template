# next-workflow-builder

## 0.7.2

### Bug Fixes

- Fix cron-triggered workflows producing "No steps recorded" on Vercel — `executeWorkflowBackground` is now awaited in the cron handler so Vercel keeps the serverless function alive until completion (consumers must set `maxDuration` on their catch-all API route)

## 0.7.1

### Features

- Add cancel execution support — stop a running workflow from the UI "Runs" tab, via API (`POST /workflows/executions/[executionId]/cancel`), or MCP `cancel_execution` tool
- Cooperative cancellation in workflow executor — checks DB status before each node execution, skips remaining steps if cancelled

### Improvements

- Migrate MCP server tools from deprecated `server.tool()` to `server.registerTool()` API

## 0.7.0

### Features

- Add opt-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI agent integration
- Expose 10 MCP tools: list/get/create/update/delete/duplicate workflows, execute workflows, get execution status, list available actions, list integrations
- OAuth 2.1 authentication via better-auth's built-in `mcp` plugin with dynamic client registration (RFC 7591)
- Streamable HTTP transport at `/api/workflow-builder/mcp`
- New `mcp` config option in `nextWorkflowBuilder()` to enable the server
- New `anonymousAuth` config option to disable anonymous authentication (defaults to `true`)
- Export `oAuthDiscoveryHandler` and `oAuthResourceHandler` from `next-workflow-builder/api` for custom `.well-known` route setups
- Add cron endpoint (`/workflow/[workflowId]/cron`) for Vercel Cron-triggered scheduled workflow execution with `CRON_SECRET` bearer token auth
- Generate correct `vercel.json` cron config in code export — use the new cron endpoint path and pass `workflowId` when available
- Ship a bundled `drizzle.config.ts` so consumers can run `drizzle-kit generate --config=node_modules/next-workflow-builder/drizzle.config.ts` without maintaining their own config
- Publish `src/server/db/schema.ts` and its dependencies (`src/server/lib/utils/id.ts`, `src/plugins/types.ts`) so drizzle-kit can resolve the schema from the published package

### Improvements

- Reduce published package size from 1.12 MB to ~664 KB by enabling JS minification and removing unused `style-prefixed.css`
- Include `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` in published package
- Add `keywords` to `package.json` for npm discoverability

### Bug Fixes

- Fix MCP OAuth discovery for Claude Desktop and other MCP clients — use better-auth's `oAuthDiscoveryMetadata` and `oAuthProtectedResourceMetadata` helpers so root-level `.well-known` endpoints work with catch-all page routes
- Fix MCP OAuth login page default from `/sign-in` to `/auth/sign-in` where the `AuthView` component renders
- Fix MCP server requiring OAuth when anonymous auth is enabled — session-authenticated requests bypass OAuth, while unauthenticated requests receive the proper 401 for OAuth discovery
- Fix hydration mismatch in `UserMenu` when session resolves before React hydration completes
- Fix anonymous sign-in returning 404 when social providers are configured — anonymous plugin is now enabled by default regardless of configured providers
- Remove non-functional `beforeFiles` rewrites for `.well-known` OAuth routes — Next.js rewrites do not override optional catch-all `[[...slug]]` page routes
- Add explicit `.well-known` route files to demo app using exported handlers
- Fix `drizzle.config.ts` failing in consumer apps — remove TypeScript-specific syntax (`satisfies`, `import type`) and `dotenv` dependency that may not be installed

## 0.5.0

### Features

- Replace free-text JavaScript condition expressions with structured n8n-style condition builder
- Add data type selection (String, Number, Boolean, Date & Time) with type-specific operators
- Add 27 operators across 4 data types: string (14), number (6), boolean (4), datetime (3)
- Template variable support on both left and right value fields
- Unary operators (exists, is empty, is true, etc.) automatically hide the right value field
- Type-aware comparisons preserve raw values instead of stringifying everything

### Breaking Changes

- Condition nodes now use `leftValue`, `dataType`, `operator`, `rightValue` config fields instead of a single `condition` expression field
- Removed `condition-validator.ts` — structured conditions don't execute arbitrary code

## 0.4.7

### Bug Fixes

- Inline `authOptions` and `databaseUrl` as build-time environment variables via Next.js `env` config. This eliminates the need for an `instrumentation.ts` file to re-set `__NWB_AUTH_OPTIONS` on Vercel serverless cold starts. Works for all auth providers (Vercel, Google, GitHub, etc.).

## 0.4.6

### Features

- Add `integrationRequiresCredentials` helper to check if an integration type requires credentials (has `formFields`). Plugins with no form fields don't need a connection.

## 0.4.5

### Bug Fixes

- Fix predecessor step output data not being passed to the next step's input. Steps now automatically receive output data from their predecessor nodes merged into their input (config values take precedence). Supports both standardized (`{ success, data: { ... } }`) and custom (`{ success, events: [...] }`) return formats.

## 0.4.4

### Bug Fixes

- Fix template variable resolution for custom plugin outputs that use non-standard return fields (e.g., `{ success: true, events: [...] }`). The auto-unwrap into `.data` now only applies when the requested field doesn't exist at the top level of the step result.

## 0.4.3

### Features

- Display Node ID in node details panel

### Bug Fixes

- Fix Loop step failing when `items` arrives as a JSON string from template processing instead of an array

## 0.4.2

### Features

- Add optional `databaseUrl` config option to `nextWorkflowBuilder()` for overriding the database connection URL instead of relying on `process.env.DATABASE_URL`

## 0.4.0

### Bug Fixes

- Register Loop, Switch, and Merge as system actions in workflow executor, fixing "Unknown action type" errors when executing these built-in plugins

## 0.3.1

### Bug Fixes

- Ensure plugins directory exists during build to prevent missing directory errors

## 0.3.0

### Features

- Add new built-in Loop plugin for iterating over arrays with batch support
- Add new built-in Merge plugin for combining data from multiple inputs
- Add new built-in Switch plugin for rule-based and expression-based routing
- Refactor steps into internal/system plugin architecture

### Bug Fixes

- Fix package metadata

### Documentation

- Add documentation for built-in plugins

## 0.2.0

### Features

- Major package restructure as `next-workflow-builder` (#1)
- Add Better-Auth-UI package replacing custom auth dialog modal
- Add `nwb` CLI with build and dev scripts
- Replace jiti with virtual turbo reference modules for plugin imports
- Pass betterAuth options props in `nextWorkflowBuilder` and Layout props
- Move plugins to consumer app (`examples/demo`) with auto-discovery
- Move layout from package to consumer app for customization
- Add virtual module declarations for plugin and step registries
- Add code generation for plugin step imports

### Bug Fixes

- Fix plugin import resolution
- Fix code generation for proper module exports
- Fix import paths and missing exports
- Fix missing metadata and README

## 0.1.0

### Features

- Initial release of `next-workflow-builder` package
- Visual workflow editor built with React Flow
- Node-based workflow execution engine with step handlers
- Plugin system with dynamic auto-generated registries
- Built-in plugins: Database Query, HTTP Request, Condition

- Workflow persistence with Drizzle ORM
- Template variable system for passing data between nodes
- Condition expression evaluation with security validation
- Workflow code export dialog
