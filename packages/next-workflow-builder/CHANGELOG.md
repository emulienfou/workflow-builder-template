# next-workflow-builder

## 0.7.7

### Features

- Add **Switch "All matches" mode** — new Match selector (`First match` / `All matches`). When set to "All matches", the Switch evaluates every route and executes all whose condition is true, instead of stopping at the first match. The executor follows all matched route handles in parallel. Default remains "First match" for backwards compatibility
- Redesign **Dashboard** page (`/dashboard`) — now shows a workflow-centric table instead of individual execution rows. Each workflow displays aggregated run stats (total, success, error, cancelled), latest run status with relative time, and inline action buttons to execute, stop, or delete workflows directly from the dashboard. Summary cards show total workflows, total runs, successes, and errors. Polls every 5 seconds for live updates
- Add `GET /workflows/dashboard` API endpoint — returns all workflows for the authenticated user with aggregated execution stats (counts by status, latest run info, running execution ID) using SQL aggregation
- Add "Dashboard" link in user dropdown menu
- Export `DashboardPage` component from `next-workflow-builder/client` for consumers with custom routing


### Bug Fixes

- Fix workflow run steps showing generic **"Action"** for unlabeled nodes — now displays the actual action type name (e.g. "Switch", "Condition", "Merge") when the node label is empty

## 0.7.6

### Features

- Add **Enum** field type to the Webhook payload schema builder — allows defining a fixed set of allowed values with a configurable value type (`string`, `number`, or `boolean`). Enum values are displayed in template autocomplete as `enum<value1 | value2 | ...>`
- Make **Switch** plugin routes fully dynamic — users can now add and remove routes with no upper limit (minimum 1). Previously hardcoded to exactly 4 routes. Existing workflows with 4 routes continue to work without migration
- Add **Switch node routing** — Switch nodes now display multiple output handles (one per route + Default) on the right side. Each handle can be connected to a different downstream node. The executor routes execution only to the matched route's connected nodes based on `sourceHandle` IDs on edges
- Add **Condition node routing** — Condition nodes now display two output handles: **True** and **False**. Each can be connected to different downstream nodes for branching. Backwards compatible with existing workflows (legacy edges without handles still work as before)
- Add **Switch route condition evaluation** — route conditions in rules mode are now properly evaluated as expressions (supports `===`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) instead of being passed as raw strings
- Fix **Switch** code generation showing `unknownStep` — Switch was missing from `SYSTEM_ACTION_TEMPLATES`, now correctly generates `switchStep` code
- Make **Merge** plugin inputs fully dynamic — users can now add and remove inputs (minimum 2, no upper limit). Previously hardcoded to exactly 2 inputs. Merge nodes display multiple labeled target handles on the left side, one per input. The executor maps incoming edges by `targetHandle` to the correct input slot. Existing workflows with 2 inputs continue to work without migration

### Bug Fixes

- Fix **Condition** Data Type select being stuck — changing the data type called `onUpdateConfig` twice in rapid succession, causing the second call to overwrite the first with stale state. Now batches both `dataType` and `operator` updates into a single atomic config change via `onUpdateMultipleConfig`

## 0.7.5

### Bug Fixes

- Fix **Clear** and **Delete** buttons on the Workflow Panel doing nothing when clicked — they were setting unused Jotai atoms instead of opening confirmation overlays. Now uses the same `ConfirmOverlay` pattern as the toolbar
- Fix **Clear Workflow** not persisting — `clearWorkflowAtom` was missing the `autosaveAtom` trigger, so cleared state was never saved to the database
- Fix **Clear Workflow** removing the Trigger node — now preserves trigger nodes, consistent with delete-node and multi-select delete behavior
- Fix deleting a workflow failing with a foreign key constraint error when the workflow has execution history — execution logs and executions are now deleted before the workflow itself

## 0.7.4

### Features

- Add `canvas` prop to `Layout` for configuring the workflow canvas
  - `canvas.snapToGrid` — enable/disable snap-to-grid alignment (default: `true`)
  - `canvas.edgeStyle` — set edge rendering style: `"smoothstep"` or `"bezier"` (default: `"smoothstep"`)
- Export `LayoutProps`, `CanvasOptions`, and `EdgeStyle` types from `next-workflow-builder/client`

### Improvements

- Default canvas to snap-to-grid for more precise node placement
- Default edge style to smooth step for cleaner, more angular connections

## 0.7.3

### Features

- Add built-in **Run Workflow** action — execute another workflow internally and wait for it to complete, bypassing HTTP entirely. Returns the sub-workflow's output for use in downstream nodes via `{{RunWorkflow.output}}`
- Add built-in **Run Workflows in Sequence** action — execute an ordered list of workflows one after another. Supports a "continue on failure" option and returns per-workflow results with pass/fail summary
- Add compound node rendering for Run Workflows in Sequence — the canvas node visually expands to show each child workflow as a numbered row with per-child status indicators (pending/success/error) after execution completes
- Each sub-workflow execution creates its own execution record, visible individually in the Runs tab

### Bug Fixes

- Fix **Loop** node only processing the first item — the executor now re-invokes the Loop step with an incremented `currentBatchIndex` after each iteration and re-executes all downstream nodes per batch until `hasMore` is false. Cancellation is checked between iterations

## 0.7.2

### Bug Fixes

- Fix cron-triggered workflows producing "No steps recorded" on Vercel — `executeWorkflowBackground` is now awaited in the cron handler so Vercel keeps the serverless function alive until completion (consumers must set `maxDuration` on their catch-all API route)

## 0.7.1

### Features

- Add cancel execution support — stop a running workflow from the UI "Runs" tab, via API (`POST /workflows/executions/[executionId]/cancel`), or MCP `cancel_execution` tool
- Cooperative cancellation in workflow executor — checks DB status before each node execution, skips remaining steps if cancelled

### Improvements

- Migrate MCP server tools from deprecated `server.tool()` to `server.registerTool()` API

## 0.7.0

### Features

- Add opt-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI agent integration
- Expose 10 MCP tools: list/get/create/update/delete/duplicate workflows, execute workflows, get execution status, list available actions, list integrations
- OAuth 2.1 authentication via better-auth's built-in `mcp` plugin with dynamic client registration (RFC 7591)
- Streamable HTTP transport at `/api/workflow-builder/mcp`
- New `mcp` config option in `nextWorkflowBuilder()` to enable the server
- New `anonymousAuth` config option to disable anonymous authentication (defaults to `true`)
- Export `oAuthDiscoveryHandler` and `oAuthResourceHandler` from `next-workflow-builder/api` for custom `.well-known` route setups
- Add cron endpoint (`/workflow/[workflowId]/cron`) for Vercel Cron-triggered scheduled workflow execution with `CRON_SECRET` bearer token auth
- Generate correct `vercel.json` cron config in code export — use the new cron endpoint path and pass `workflowId` when available
- Ship a bundled `drizzle.config.ts` so consumers can run `drizzle-kit generate --config=node_modules/next-workflow-builder/drizzle.config.ts` without maintaining their own config
- Publish `src/server/db/schema.ts` and its dependencies (`src/server/lib/utils/id.ts`, `src/plugins/types.ts`) so drizzle-kit can resolve the schema from the published package

### Improvements

- Reduce published package size from 1.12 MB to ~664 KB by enabling JS minification and removing unused `style-prefixed.css`
- Include `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` in published package
- Add `keywords` to `package.json` for npm discoverability

### Bug Fixes

- Fix MCP OAuth discovery for Claude Desktop and other MCP clients — use better-auth's `oAuthDiscoveryMetadata` and `oAuthProtectedResourceMetadata` helpers so root-level `.well-known` endpoints work with catch-all page routes
- Fix MCP OAuth login page default from `/sign-in` to `/auth/sign-in` where the `AuthView` component renders
- Fix MCP server requiring OAuth when anonymous auth is enabled — session-authenticated requests bypass OAuth, while unauthenticated requests receive the proper 401 for OAuth discovery
- Fix hydration mismatch in `UserMenu` when session resolves before React hydration completes
- Fix anonymous sign-in returning 404 when social providers are configured — anonymous plugin is now enabled by default regardless of configured providers
- Remove non-functional `beforeFiles` rewrites for `.well-known` OAuth routes — Next.js rewrites do not override optional catch-all `[[...slug]]` page routes
- Add explicit `.well-known` route files to demo app using exported handlers
- Fix `drizzle.config.ts` failing in consumer apps — remove TypeScript-specific syntax (`satisfies`, `import type`) and `dotenv` dependency that may not be installed

## 0.5.0

### Features

- Replace free-text JavaScript condition expressions with structured n8n-style condition builder
- Add data type selection (String, Number, Boolean, Date & Time) with type-specific operators
- Add 27 operators across 4 data types: string (14), number (6), boolean (4), datetime (3)
- Template variable support on both left and right value fields
- Unary operators (exists, is empty, is true, etc.) automatically hide the right value field
- Type-aware comparisons preserve raw values instead of stringifying everything

### Breaking Changes

- Condition nodes now use `leftValue`, `dataType`, `operator`, `rightValue` config fields instead of a single `condition` expression field
- Removed `condition-validator.ts` — structured conditions don't execute arbitrary code

## 0.4.7

### Bug Fixes

- Inline `authOptions` and `databaseUrl` as build-time environment variables via Next.js `env` config. This eliminates the need for an `instrumentation.ts` file to re-set `__NWB_AUTH_OPTIONS` on Vercel serverless cold starts. Works for all auth providers (Vercel, Google, GitHub, etc.).

## 0.4.6

### Features

- Add `integrationRequiresCredentials` helper to check if an integration type requires credentials (has `formFields`). Plugins with no form fields don't need a connection.

## 0.4.5

### Bug Fixes

- Fix predecessor step output data not being passed to the next step's input. Steps now automatically receive output data from their predecessor nodes merged into their input (config values take precedence). Supports both standardized (`{ success, data: { ... } }`) and custom (`{ success, events: [...] }`) return formats.

## 0.4.4

### Bug Fixes

- Fix template variable resolution for custom plugin outputs that use non-standard return fields (e.g., `{ success: true, events: [...] }`). The auto-unwrap into `.data` now only applies when the requested field doesn't exist at the top level of the step result.

## 0.4.3

### Features

- Display Node ID in node details panel

### Bug Fixes

- Fix Loop step failing when `items` arrives as a JSON string from template processing instead of an array

## 0.4.2

### Features

- Add optional `databaseUrl` config option to `nextWorkflowBuilder()` for overriding the database connection URL instead of relying on `process.env.DATABASE_URL`

## 0.4.0

### Bug Fixes

- Register Loop, Switch, and Merge as system actions in workflow executor, fixing "Unknown action type" errors when executing these built-in plugins

## 0.3.1
